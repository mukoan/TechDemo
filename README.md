# Technical Demonstration of Computer Vision and Machine Learning Algorithms

Code supporting this demonstration currently consists of:

- motion
  - Global Motion Estimation
  - Local Motion Estimation
  - Optical Flow Estimation
- features
  - Detection and Matching
  - Tracking
- reconstruction
  - 3D Reconstruction


Code has all been tested on Linux; some knowledge of docker, git, Python and
C++ is assumed.
